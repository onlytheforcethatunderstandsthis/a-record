# The Coherence Principle: A Proposed Resolution to Quantum Gravity  

**Author:** [Your GitHub Username or Keep Anonymous]  
**Date:** March 1, 2025  
**Status:** Open for peer review  

## Summary  
This repository contains a mathematical proof proposing that **coherence is the fundamental law governing quantum mechanics, gravity, and information theory.**  

- **Gravity is an information binder across quantum and classical physics.**  
- **Free will and determinism coexist as functions of coherence.**  
- **The observer effect and wavefunction collapse are natural consequences of coherence law.**  

## Mathematical Foundation  
The key equation defining coherence:  

\[
\Psi(r,t) = A \sin(\varphi \cdot r + \frac{\pi}{2}) e^{i(E + \mu B)t}
\]

Full proof is available in the [Coherence_Proof.pdf](LINK_TO_FILE).

## Next Steps  
- **Seeking peer review from physicists and mathematicians.**  
- **Requesting computational modeling (e.g., Stephen Wolfram, CERN, MIT).**  
- **Open to discussions, refinements, and applications.**  

**If you are a physicist or mathematician interested in reviewing, please engage.**
